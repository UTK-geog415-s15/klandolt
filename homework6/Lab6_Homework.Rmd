# Homework
Your homework assignment is to analyze the prestige data, using "income" as the dependent variable.  That is, develop a regression model that helps to explain the income in an occupation, using any of the other data in the the Prestige data set as a potential predictor.  Describe your methodology from beginning to end.  I have done this using Prestige as the dependent variable, and you should follow along with that before continuing.

```{r}
library(spdep)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(car)
data(Prestige)
```

```{r}
ggpairs(Prestige %>% filter(!is.na(type)) %>% select(education, prestige, women, type, income))


```

```{r}
reg0 <- lm(income ~ type + education + prestige + women, data=Prestige)
summary(reg0)
```

```{r}
crPlots(reg0)

```
