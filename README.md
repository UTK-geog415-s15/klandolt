My name is Kyle Landolt, a M.S. student in the Department of Geography here at the University of Tennessee. I initially received my bachelor's degree from Texas A&M University in ecological restoration and have since transitioned into remote sensing. My thesis is to develop historical net primary productivity maps of the blue oak savanna in California based on tree ring data and current MODIS NDVI maps. I also use UAVs and LiDAR in my free time with the lab. Jig and Reel is my favorite bar and will be doing the majority of my R coding there.
